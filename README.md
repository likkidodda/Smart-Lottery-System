# Smart-Lottery-System

# Why a Decentralized Lottery System?
Lottery games are dependent on luck, the outcome is unknown and there can be many scams and issues in the traditional centralized system.
The participants should have to trust that the lottery owners declare the winners honestly, which actually is corrupted these days.
And in a Centralized Lottery System the lottery owners or the companies should maintain the severs and staff for ticket counting creation and verification.
To overcome all these issues a Block chain based decentralised lottery System is designed.
This Block chain based decentralized lottery System can fix the issue by providing a platform that can’t be hacked or corrupted.
A smart contract is implemented in such a way that the winner is chosen randomly, and this can be proved.
A distributed ledger is used to update the participants about all the changes and the updates i.e. The winner declarations in the lottery.
So, the participants can trust that their money is treated fairly.
# Building a Smart Lottery System:
In order to build a smart lottery system here are the few things we need to consider:
1. The participants should buy a lottery ticket.
2. The owner should generate the winner randomly.
3. The winning amount should be settled.

Before the first step let’s say the owner wants to keep a track of all the participants in his lottery. So, the owner wants to register every user who want to participate in his lottery.
To buy a ticket, the participant should have to be registered by the owner first. So now the participant can buy any number of tickets he wants to buy and the smart contract randomly generates unique ticket numbers and assign it to the participant’s Address.
Here we can observe that this blockchain based system reduced the overhead of generating the tickets manually and selling them.
Every lottery has a start time and end time. So, all the participants can register to the lottery system and buy any number of tickets until the lottery time ends
Once the lottery time is ended any user/participant cannot buy lottery tickets. As a matter of transparency, the owner should be able to declare winners only after the lottery time ended and only owner should have the access of generating/declaring Winners.
Once the winner is declared the distributed ledger is updated and all the users get to see the winner of the lottery and from the interface, they can click on seeWinner( ) function that is going to be created in the smart contract and see the address of the winner.
The final step after declaring the winner is the payment settlement. The owner gets a gain from the lottery and the gain amount is settled to the owner’s wallet and the winning amount is settled to the winner’s wallet

# ERC token:
In the traditional centralised system the participants use their normal currency to buy the tickets and the winning amount is settled to the winner in the same currency.
But as this is a blockchain based system a new ERC token is implemented in Ethereum for this smart lottery System.
The name of the token is “LWTcoin” and the symbol of the token is “LWT” i.e. “Lottery with Transparency”.
LWT stands for lottery with transparency. We chose this as token symbol because it clearly reflects the main intention of the smart lottery system and thereby increasing the ease of usage of the token with understanding.
Lottery transactions might not use decimal tokens but just for the convinence of the user 2 decimal points were added.
